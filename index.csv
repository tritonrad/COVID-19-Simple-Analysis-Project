GEOID: Identification codes for each unique statistical geographic area for which the data is tabulated.
GEOIDs are made up of Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
GEO: General description of geographic boundary type.
NAME: Name of the geographic boundary.
DATE: Date and time that the data was last updated and published. These data include cases reported the
previous day and earlier. Date is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 
NEGATIVE: Cumulative total number of people who tested negative for COVID-19. This includes diagnostic, confirmatory test results only (those are PCR or NAT tests that detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV2 virus). Before March 30, 2020, the number of negative results included non-Wisconsin residents. Starting on March 30, 2020, the number of people with negative results was changed to include Wisconsin residents only. As a result, there was a decline in the number of negative test results reported from March 29, 2020 to March 30, 2020. In addition, the number of people with negative test results includes only test results reported electronically to DHS or entered manually into the WEDSS electronic laboratory module. As a result, this number underestimates the total number of Wisconsin residents with negative test results.

As a result, this number underestimates the total number of Wisconsin residents with negative test results.
TEST_NEW: Number of people with diagnostic, confirmatory test results for COVID-19 (PCR or NAT test to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA) newly reported since the previous day. This is the sum of POS_NEW and NEG_NEW.
